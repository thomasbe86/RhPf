IDEAS FOR NEXT VERSION:

-TRY AND SEE IF REPLACING J1 & J2 WITH 6.35mm 1/4" Right Angle Mono Female Connector Thread Lock Panel Mount CK635008 SKU A-6976 FROM TAYDA IS A GOOD IDEA...

-IF THE UNPLEASANT VOLUME DROP OR ASYMETRIC CLIPPING PERSISTS, TRY SYMETRIC CLIPPING FOR ALL STAGES. TRY DIFFERENT CLIPPING OPTIONS; WITH SOCKETS FOR Q1? Q2? ETC.
-IF TOO MUCH GAIN, REDUCE DRIVE A R23 SEE TRIMPOT ON VERSION 02 DEC 2024


I ADDED TWO TRIMMERS ON VERSION 02 DEC 2024; POINT IS WITH 
ALL AT 12, A LITTLE LOUDER THAN UNITY
ALL AT 12, LEVEL AT MAX, DRIVE AT 0, A LITTLE LOUDER THAN UNITY
ALL AT 12, LEVEL AT 0, DRIVE AT MAX, A LITTLE LOUDER THAN UNITY
BUT NOT EXTREMELY LOUDER THAN UNITY AT THE ABOVE POINTS
