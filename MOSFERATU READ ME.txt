IDEAS FOR NEXT VERSION:

-TRY AND SEE IF REPLACING J1 & J2 WITH 6.35mm 1/4" Right Angle Mono Female Connector Thread Lock Panel Mount CK635008 SKU A-6976 FROM TAYDA IS A GOOD IDEA...

-ADJUST THE FIXED RESISTANCE BEFORE DRIVE_A, WAY TO DO THIS IS TO LEAVE A 24k RESISTOR BETWEEN LEG 1 AND 2 OF DRIVE_B INSTEAD OF THE SECOND GAND OF THE DUAL POTENTIOMETER AND USE A SINGLE GANG POT FOR DRIVE_A, THEN MEASURE THE LOWEST ACCEPTABLE RESISTANCE FOR DRIVE_A, CAN BE INCREASED TO WHATEVER MAKES SENSE, MAYBE 100k?

-IF THE UNPLEASANT VOLUME DROP OR ASYMETRIC CLIPPING PERSISTS, TRY SYMETRIC CLIPPING FOR ALL STAGES.

-IN ANY CASE, KEEP LOOKING FOR 9MM ALPS DUAL GANG POTENTIOMETER HIGHER THAN 100k FOR DRIVE; RESISTOR IN PARALLEL TO DRIVE_B WILL BE NEEDED TO DECREASE ITS RESISTANCE BACK TO 100k.
